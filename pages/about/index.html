I lived in Ukraine for more than 30 years. When I was 11, I began learning programming in <a href=http://sfera.org.ua/ class="reference external">Sphere</a>. Last 2 grades of an elementary school I was taking extra programming classes and got a certificate of assistant-programmer. First years at a high school, I got realy interested in administering a FidoNet node and digging into the Internet. I graduated from the <a href=http://www.inter.kpi.ua/ class="reference external">National Technical University of Ukraine</a> and got a Masters Degree in Radio and Television Engineering.
