There was the time when computer programs were so much long and unstructured
that some times just a few people managed to logically navigate source code
in huge software projects. Having low-level programming languages, programmers
used various equivalents of "goto statements" for conditional branching that
often led to decreasing readability and difficulties in keeping a logical
context, especially jumping too far to another subroutine.

A few things happened on the way to a solution that eventually appeared in the
form of `Structured Programming Paradigm`_. In 1966, *Corrado BÃ¶hm* and *Guiseppe Jacopini*
proved a theorem_ that any computer program which might be represented as a flow diagram
can be rewritten using only 3 control structures (sequence, selection, iteration).

| 

In 1968, *Edsger W. Dijkstra* published the influential article "`Go To Statement Considered Harmful`_"
where he pointed out that using too many **goto** statements has a negative effect
on the readability and understanding of computer programs. Though, his intention
was, unfortunately, misunderstood and misused by the almost complete abandoning
of using "goto" in high-level programming languages, even at the cost of less
readable and vague code.

| 

As a result of working on the improvement of the ALGOL, *Niklaus Wirth* designed
a new imperative programming language, Pascal_, which was released in 1970.
It was widely used for teaching students the Structured Programming Design for
a few decades since then.
