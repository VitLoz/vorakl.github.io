:summary: A brief overview of my life path and a professional career

I was born in Kiev, on a territory of UkrSSR_, which later became an independent country. I lived in Ukraine for more than 30 years. When I was 12, I began learning programming in Sphere_. Last 2 grades of an elementary school I was taking extra programming classes and got a certificate of assistant-programmer. First years at a high school, I got realy interested in administering a FidoNet node and digging into the Internet.
