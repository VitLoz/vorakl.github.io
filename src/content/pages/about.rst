:summary: A brief overview of my professional interests and what you can find in this blog

|avatara| 
I'm Oleksii Tsvietnov.
I've been working as a Systems Engineer since 2004. 
Last couple of years I design, build and maintain distributed infrastructures
and platforms for running high-available applications. I have a wide range
of skills in Computer Networks, Unix/Linux Operating Systems and Programming.
At the moment, I'm focussed on Networks, Distributed Systems, Clouds,
Virtualization and Automation.

In this technical blog I'm going to share my knowledge and write mostly about:

* Clouds (Infrastructure and Platform layers)
* Automation and Programming
* Networks and Systems Engineering
* Performance tunning and Troubleshooting
* ...and many, many other aspects of Systems Engineering and Operations
