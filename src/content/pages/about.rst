I am Oleksii Tsvietnov. I have a wide range of skills in Computer Networks, Unix/Linux Operating Systems and Programming.
In the recent years, I have been interested in Programming, Distributed Systems, Clouds, Networks, and Virtualization.

My career began as a Computer Systems Engineer in 2004.
Since then, I worked for small, medium and large companies in Ukraine, Poland, and Germany.
I was designing, building and maintaining computer networks, distributed infrastructures, and platforms for running high-available applications.
Now, I am living in Munich, Germany and working as a Software Developer at IBM.

In this technical blog I'm going to share my knowledge and write mostly about:

* Automation and Programming
* Networks and Systems Engineering
* Clouds (Infrastructure and Platform layers)
* Performance Tuning and Troubleshooting
* ... and many, many other aspects of Systems and Software Engineering
