Structured Programming Paradigm
###############################

	**Corrado BÃ¶hm, Guiseppe Jacopini, 1966**
		Proved that *any computer program*, which might be represented as a flow diagram, can be rewritten using only 3 control structures:
		* sequence
		* selection
		* iteration

			Essentially, this means that any part of a program can be replaced by a code block that has one input and one output. Hence, there is  no need to jump too far across the code losing a context and the main idea


	**Niklaus Wirth, 1970**
		Created **Pascal** language for teaching students Structured Programming

	**Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1968**
		Published the famous article: *"**Goto** statement is considered harmful"*
			Raises a hot topic: using **goto** for branching
			leads to more problems than it solves
